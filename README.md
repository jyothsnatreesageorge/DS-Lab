This repositiry contains the questions to be implemented in the lab as part of **S3 Course on Data Structures Lab (KTU Scheme 2019).**  
All the questions are solved using **C programming language.**

2. Given a string s, write a C program to find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. Also, display the substring.  
3. Write a program to find the smallest number in a list of integers using pointers.  
4. Implement the following string library functions using pointers:  
                           string length (int StringLengh (char *s))
